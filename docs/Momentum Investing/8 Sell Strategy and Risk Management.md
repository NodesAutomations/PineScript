## Exhaustion Tops

Exhaustion tops happen when a stock that has had a significant run up, starts consolidating on high volumes after a parabolic move.

This high volume consolidation signifies that institutions are selling the shares while retail is buying

Along with that news about the stock is very positive. This is being done to make retail buy. (The news of adani becoming the 3rd richest and all the new contracts that adani is getting)
